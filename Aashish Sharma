from instabot import Bot

bot = Bot()

def ig_live_broadcast(welcome):
    bot.login(username="_itz_sharma_boys_", password="7604836445.as")
    bot.send_live_message(hello how are you)

if __name__ == '__Ashish sharma__':
    message = "Hello from IG Live!"
    ig_live_broadcast(message)
```
Replace "_itz_sharma_boys_" and "7604836455.as" with your actual Instagram username and password.
This script logs in to your Instagram account and sends a live message with the specified text.
Note: Make sure to install the instabot library by running `pip install instabot` in your terminal.
Also, be aware that automating Instagram actions may violate their terms of service and could result in account suspension.
Here's an example of a more advanced script that takes a video file and broadcasts it on IG Live:
```
from instabot import Bot
from instabot.api import API

bot = Bot()
api = API(bot)

def ig_live_broadcast(video_file):
    bot.login(username="_itz_sharma_boys_", password="7604836455 as")
    api.upload_video(video_file, caption="IG Live Broadcast")

if __name__ == '__Ashish sharma__':
    video_file = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
    ig_live_broadcast(video_file)
